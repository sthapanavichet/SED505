1. The training model will be on a small device with limited computational resources and memory. C/C++ uses the least amount of memory, as it doesn’t have any garbage collection or other abstractions hidden away by the language. C/C++ uses far less memory, and the instructions are more efficient than those in any other language.

2. It can be used to implement applications where the model represents the backend, the controller handles requests from the user and sends responses back, and the views represent the frontend (desktop, web browser, etc.). In game development, the model represents the game itself, the controller handles user inputs (touch, keyboard, mouse, etc.), and the view can be platforms like PC, iOS, Android, etc.

3. A test build might behave differently from a release build because of the instructions in the test build that are not included in the release build. It might also behave differently because the test build is running on different hardware or in different environments.

4. I used an interface class for the view component only because it makes it easier when there are multiple views. The model component should have an interface class too, but since there is only one model in this assignment, I didn’t see any reason for using interface classes. However, in the real world, there might be multiple models for predicting the sine wave, so it would be wise to make an interface class for the model. The controller doesn’t really need any interface classes unless we assume that different types of controllers will be implemented. But with the way the project is structured, it is unlikely that we would need multiple controllers.
